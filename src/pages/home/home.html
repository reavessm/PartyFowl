        If you've ever had an idea, but thought you didn't have the time, skills, or energy to do it a hackathon is a great place to get started. You can take 12 hours and flesh out your idea, and begin bringing it to life. While you're hacking away, you may make new friends who would like to join your team in creating your app idea. If you need, a little extra help there will be mentors and volunteers to provide advice if you need some extra help along the way.
